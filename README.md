# Statistical Rethinking - Richard McElreath

I am working though Dr.McElreath's book Statistical Rethinking. This repository contains my solutions to his HW problems. I have also included other notebooks which show how to reporduce his R code with pyMC3. I was unable to run pymc3 efficiently on my windows 10 machine using python 3 and anaconda so I switched to py27 (I needed to install mingw and cython seperately).
